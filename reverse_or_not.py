# Example 1:

# Input: s = "the sky is blue"
# Output: "blue is sky the"
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "  hello world  "
# Output: "world hello"
# Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "a good   example"
# Output: "example good a"
# Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

# def reverseword(s):
s = "a good   example"
lst = s.split()
lst1 = lst[-1::-1]
s = " ".join(lst1)
print(s)
Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
Example 2:

Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
